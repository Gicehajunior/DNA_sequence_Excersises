; No. 1: - DNA Count
; Write a function called DNA-COUNT that counts and returns the number of each nucleotide in the given string sequence regardless of whether it's uppercase or lowercase.

; The unit test below includes test cases that your solution for this exercise must pass.

; Exercise 2: Next Prime
; The problem of finding ways to test if numbers are prime has fascinated mathematicians since ancient times. 
; One way to test if a number is prime is to find the numberâ€™s divisors. 
; The program below finds the smallest integer divisor (greater than 1) of a given number n. 
; It does this by testing n for divisibility by successive integers starting with 2.
(defun divides? (a b)
    (= (rem b a) 0)) ; calculates the remainder of b/a and checks if it is zero.

; What you are asked

; No 1: Next Prime

; and returns the smallest prime greater than n. See unit test below for examples of what this function returns.
